## üìä SQL Query Used
```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,

Analysis Summary
The SQL query groups sales data by year and month, calculating both total revenue and the number of unique orders. February shows peak performance, possibly due to seasonal or promotional campaigns. This analysis supports business decisions on demand forecasting, inventory management, and marketing.
